## Book Scraper and API

#### Overview

This project is a Python-based application that combines web scraping, database integration, and API development to collect book data from the BooksToScrape website and store it in a PostgreSQL database. The application also provides a RESTful API built with FastAPI to query and filter the book data.

The project aims to:

    1. Scrape book details (title, price, category, rating, availability, etc.) from the BooksToScrape website.

    2. Store the scraped data in a PostgreSQL database.

    3. Expose the data via an API with filtering capabilities (e.g., by category, price, rating, and availability).
